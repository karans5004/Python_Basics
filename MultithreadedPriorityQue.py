The Queue module is primarily used to manage to process large amounts of data on multiple threads. It supports the creation of a new queue object that can take a distinct number of items.
The get() and put() methods are used to add or remove items from a queue respectively. Below is the list of operations that are used to manage Queue:

    get(): It is used to add an item to a queue.
    put(): It is used to remove an item from a queue.
    qsize(): It is used to find the number of items in a queue.
    empty(): It returns a boolean value depending upon whether the queue is empty or not.
    full(): It returns a boolean value depending upon whether the queue is full or not.

A Priority Queue is an extension of the queue with the following properties:

    An element with high priority is dequeued before an element with low priority.
    If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.

Below is a code example explaining the process of creating multi-threaded priority queue:
